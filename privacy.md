We will combine this Personal Data with information you give to us and information we collect about you.

## Cookies

Our Websites uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Websites. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Websites and allows us to improve our Websites. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies, however, your ability to use the Websites or the Services might be affected.

## Uses made of the information

We process your Personal Data for the following purposes:

It is **necessary to perform our contract with you to**:

-   carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered between you and us and to provide you with the information, products, and services that you request from us;Â 
-   notify you about changes to our products or services;
-   facilitate the continuation or termination of the contractual relationship; and
-   administering and facilitating any other transaction between you and us.

It is **necessary for compliance with an applicable legal or regulatory obligation** to which we are subject to:

-   comply with requests from regulatory, governmental, tax, and law enforcement authorities;
-   surveillance and investigation;
-   carry out audit checks;
-   prevent and detect fraud; and

For our **legitimate interests** or those of a third party:

We only rely on these interests where we have considered that, on balance, our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms.

We monitor communications where the law requires us to do so. We will also monitor where we are required to do so to comply with our regulatory rules and practices and, where we are permitted to do so, to protect our business and the security of our systems.

## Disclosure of your personal data

We share your Personal Data, for the purposes of:

-   managing the relationship with you;

-   selected third parties including business partners, suppliers, and sub-contractors;
-   if we sell or buy any business or assets, the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or
-   if Curator or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case Personal Data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

We share your Personal Data with tax authorities:

-   to comply with applicable laws and regulations;
-   where required by EEA tax authorities (who, in turn, may share your Personal Data with foreign tax authorities); and
-   where required by foreign tax authorities, including outside of the EEA.

We share your Personal Data with our lawyers, auditors and other professional advisors for purposes of:

-   providing you with our products and services; and

In exceptional circumstances, we will share your Personal Data with competent regulatory, prosecuting and other governmental agencies or litigation counterparties, in any country or territory.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Websites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

## Do you have to provide us with personal data?

Unless otherwise indicated, you should assume that we require the Personal Data for business and/or compliance purposes.

Some of the Personal Data we request is necessary for us to provide our product or perform our services with you and if you do not wish to provide us with this Personal Data, it will affect our ability to provide our products or services to you.

## Sending your personal data overseas

We will transfer your Personal Data to other members in our group and related parties and to third party service providers, including outside of the EU and EEA, which do not have similarly strict data protection privacy laws.

Where we transfer Personal Data to our associates or service providers, we have put in place data transfer agreements and safeguards based on European Commission approved terms.

Please contact us if you would like to know more about these agreements or receive a copy of them. Please see below for our contact details.

## Consent and your right to withdraw it

We do not generally rely on obtaining your consent to process your Personal Data.

If we do, for example in respect of processing your data in respect of marketing purposes, you have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data at any time. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at <legal@openzeppelin.com>.

## Retention and deletion of your personal data

We keep your Personal Data for as long as it is required by us for our legitimate business purposes, to perform our services and/or contractual obligations, or where longer, such longer period as is required by law or regulatory obligations which apply to us. Some Personal Data will be retained after your relationship with us ends. As a general principle, we do not retain your Personal Data for longer than we need it. We will usually delete your Personal Data (at the latest) when there is no longer any legal or regulatory requirement or business purpose for retaining your Personal Data.

## Automated decision-making

We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or otherwise significantly affecting you, based solely on automated processing of Personal Data, unless we have considered the proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that it meets the requirements of EU data protection legislation and other applicable laws.

## Your rights

You have certain data protection rights, including:

-   the right to access your Personal Data;
-   the right to restrict the use of your Personal Data;
-   the right to have incomplete or inaccurate Personal Data corrected;
-   the right to ask us to stop processing your Personal Data; and
