<h2>Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration</h2>
<p>Any dispute, claim, suit, action, cause of action, demand or proceeding arising out or in connection with these
  Terms (any of the foregoing occurrences, a "Dispute"), or the breach, termination or invalidity
  thereof shall first be endeavored to be settled through amicable negotiations in good faith by you and
  OpenZeppelin. If you and OpenZeppelin cannot agree how to resolve such Dispute within thirty (30) consecutive
  calendar days after the date a notice with respect to such Dispute is received by the other party, then either
  you or OpenZeppelin may, as appropriate, commence an arbitration proceeding. Such Dispute shall subsequently
  (and exclusively) be submitted to three arbitrators. The nomination of the arbitrators and the rules of
  arbitration shall be in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of Cayman Islands. The seat of the arbitral
  tribunal shall be Cayman Islands. Language of the proceedings shall be English. The arbitral award is final and
  binding upon the parties. The arbitration fees will be borne by the losing party except otherwise awarded by the
  arbitral tribunal. The parties undertake to carry out the arbitral award in accordance with the modalities of
  said reward. Any Dispute that is not or cannot be subject to arbitration will be resolved by the courts of
  Cayman Islands.</p>
<h2>Termination/Access Restriction</h2>
<p>To the extent it has ability to do so, OpenZeppelin may terminate your access to a specific portion of the
  Services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice.</p>
<p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and
  OpenZeppelin as a result of these Terms or use of the Services. OpenZeppelin's performance of these Terms
  is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of
  OpenZeppelin's right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
  relating to your use of the Services, or information provided to or gathered by OpenZeppelin with respect to
  such use. If any part of these Terms are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law
  including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
  invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
  matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and OpenZeppelin
  with respect to the Services and these Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and
  proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and OpenZeppelin with respect to the Services. A
  printed version of the most recent version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
  admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent
  and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained
  in printed form. These Terms were drafted in the English language and such English language version of these
  Terms shall control any interpretation of these Terms.</p>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or
  otherwise transferred by you without OpenZeppelin's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment,
  subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. OpenZeppelin shall be free to assign these Terms without notice or consent in connection with an
  acquisition of stock or assets, merger, or other corporate reorganization.</p>

<p>OpenZeppelin reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change these Terms. The most current version of
  these Terms will supersede all previous versions. OpenZeppelin encourages you to periodically review these Terms
  to stay informed of our updates.</p>
<h2>NOT BOILERPLATE</h2>
<p>These Terms are not boilerplate. If you disagree with any of them, believe that any should not apply to you, or
  wish to negotiate these Terms, please contact us at <a
    href="mailto:legal@openzeppelin.com">legal@openzeppelin.com</a> and immediately navigate away from the
  Services. Do not use the Services until you and OpenZeppelin have agreed upon new terms of service.</p>
