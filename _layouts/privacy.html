<h2>Who is providing this notice?</h2>
<p>The relevant OpenZeppelin entity responsible for the processing of your personal data is zOS Global Limited, a company registered under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the &ldquo;<strong>Curator</strong>&rdquo;).

The Curator and OpenZeppelin are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>This notice and any other documents referred to in it sets out the basis on which any Personal Data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. When you provide us with your Personal Data, we act as a "data controller". In simple terms, this means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>we control the Personal Data that you provide - including making sure that it is kept secure; and</li>
<li>we make certain decisions on how to use and protect your Personal Data - but only to the extent that we have informed you about the use or are otherwise permitted by law.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your Personal Data and how we will treat it.</strong></p>

If you do choose to remove or reject cookies, however, your ability to use the Websites or the Services might be affected.</p>

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>Do you have to provide us with personal data?</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, you should assume that we require the Personal Data for business and/or compliance purposes.</p>

<h2>Retention and deletion of your personal data</h2>
<p>We keep your Personal Data for as long as it is required by us for our legitimate business purposes, to perform our services and/or contractual obligations, or where longer, such longer period as is required by law or regulatory obligations which apply to us. Some Personal Data will be retained after your relationship with us ends. As a general principle, we do not retain your Personal Data for longer than we need it. We will usually delete your Personal Data (at the latest) when there is no longer any legal or regulatory requirement or business purpose for retaining your Personal Data.</p>
<h2>Automated decision-making</h2>
<p>We will not take decisions producing legal effects concerning you, or otherwise significantly affecting you, based solely on automated processing of Personal Data, unless we have considered the proposed processing in a particular case and concluded in writing that it meets the requirements of EU data protection legislation and other applicable laws.</p>
